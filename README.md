# Quality Analysis of Clinical Ethics Consults

Our small group of two planned and completed a capstone project over a two-term sequence, BIOST 596 Biostatistics Capstone Project Planning and BIOST 597: Biostatistics Capstone Project Implementation. This capstone was a culminating project for the Biostatistics degree program, and in this project, we aimed to rank consultants in terms of completion and quality of clinical ethics consultations.

The report, presentation slides, and R code are uploaded to this repository. The dataset belongs to the University of Washington Bioethics department and as such is not shared.

# Lessons Learned

During the course of this project, our capstone group worked alongside members of the [University of Washington Bioethics department](https://depts.washington.edu/bhdept/). This allowed us to get real-world experience in working with a sponsor and their dataset to answer questions relevant to their line of work that will ultimately have an impact on the department. We also gained valuable experience in data cleaning, visualization, and in the presentation of an extensive project.
